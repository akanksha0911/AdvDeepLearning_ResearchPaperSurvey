# “Few-shot Graph Classification with Contrastive Loss and Meta-classifier”

## what is a few-shot classification?
Few-shot classification aims to learn a classifier to recognize unseen classes during training with limited labeled examples.

# Introduction:
“Few-shot Graph Classification with Contrastive Loss and Meta-classifier,” a paper by Chao Wei and Zhidong Deng, investigates the problem of few-shot graph classification. They presented a novel graph contrastive relation network (GCRNet) by introducing a practical yet straightforward graph meta-baseline with contrastive loss and meta-classifier, which achieved comparable performance for graph few-shot learning.
